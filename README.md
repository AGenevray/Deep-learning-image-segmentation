#### Deep Learning - 02456 - DTU ####

This Git repository is set up for the course project number 18 - Image segmentation supervised by Toke Faurby.

Two notebooks are provided :
- DEMO.ipynb :
    This notebook load the datasets with trained networks and run the test loop with displays of accuracy, IoU and output labels. To change between datasets and convolution variations it is needed to uncomment the corresponding lines in the second cell, and comment the line corresponding to other versions. Datasets are downloaded automatically and the networks are provided in this repository (downloaded automatically as well)


- Tiramisu-Depthwise.ipynb :
     This notebook is the main one, it is used for training, testing and saving the networks.
